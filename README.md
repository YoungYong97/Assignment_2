# Idea
- I got the inspiration from zombie survival games where the theme is the player controls a character looking from birds eye view and swarms of zombies will spawn and attack the player's character
- I modified the idea to which the player controls a stationary turret and enenmys will spawn from edges of the screen and move towards the player.

# Development
- I started by making the shooter in the center of the screen. The shooter can not move to other locations but can rotate.
- Then I made the bullet class and the enemy class. I created Arraylists for the enemys and the bullets.

# How to Play
- Rotate the turret using A or D key.
- Press the Spacebar to shoot.

# Features
- The bullets gets removed when the bullet is outside of the screen or when it hits an enemy.
- The enemy is removed when its healthy is zero.
